# challenge-2

I started out the project by breaking down the instructions into a simpler way that I could understand them.

I then went and made a CSS and an Html file.

I made an outline then started working through the basic functional requirements on the html.

After getting the html functioning properly how I wanted it to i went back through it and organized it to make it more readable.

I then went to the CSS and started working through styling it. Here I ran into a few issues, but was able to work through it with help from my tutoring session tuesday night.

After styling the website I went through and made sure that the site looked good on multiple different styles of screens.
