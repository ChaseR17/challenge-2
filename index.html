            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi my name is Chase Gilhart and I have a passion for learning! <br/><br/> I have tackled most every athletic adventure from surfing double overhead waves in Nicaragua to hitting the backcountry in Revelstoke snowboarding... I even spent some time as semi-professional racing driver. These athletic accomplishments whilst may seem to not have anything to do with programming actually have quite a bit to do with it as learning all of these random skills and tricks I have figured out how to problem solve in ways that are quite unique. Coding has allowed me to be able to continue to problem solve when my body is sore from whatever athletic endeavor it may be and keep my brain actively thinking.  </p>
